# ✈️ AeroInsight

> Our objective is to build a modern, scalable Safety Assessment Tool for Nepal's aviation sector. The application will allow airlines and regulators to digitally record, classify, analyze, and track aviation safety reports (VSRs and MORs) to improve safety performance, aligning with ICAO and CAAN standards.

This project is being built iteratively, one milestone at a time.
